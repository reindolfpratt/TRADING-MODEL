# TRADING-MODEL
This model can be used to do analysis and predict trades, it shows you historical data on wins and losses had you trained and advice to either short, long or wait.


ðŸŸ¢ **BUY happens when:**
Recent prices are going UP faster than overall prices
Like: "Last 20 days are rising faster than last 50 days"
Stock isn't too expensive already
Not at a peak that could crash
Lots of people are trading it
Real buying happening, not fake movement
**All 3 must be YES â†’ Code says BUY**



âšª **WAIT happens when:**
Even one of those conditions is NO â†’ Code says do nothing



ðŸ”´ **SELL happens when:**
Recent prices start going DOWN compared to overall trend


Stock shows weakness
Think of it like: The code only says BUY when the stock is clearly going up, not too expensive, and lots of people agree (by trading it). Otherwise it says WAIT to avoid bad trades.
